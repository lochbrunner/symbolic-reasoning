# Real World Problems

## Closed Problems

### Constraints

* Only one type of numbers (e.g. natural or real numbers)
* Only a limited number of rules

### Examples

* [Number Crunching](./number_crunching/README.md)
* [Basic Math](./basics/README.md)
* [Advanced Math](./advanced/README.md)
* [Trigonometric identities](./trigonometric_identities/README.md)
* [Differential Calculus](./differential_calculus/README.md)
* [Differential Equations](./differential_equations/README.md)

#### Multiplication of large integers

* Using memory

##### Rules

Defining the numbers

* 1+1=2
* 1+2=3
* ...

Defining multiplication

* n = 1*n
* a\*b+a\*c = a\*(b+c)

This should be enough

## Open Problems

* Parsing the internet

### Propositional Logic


### Mathematical Derivations

* Using lectures from mathematics and physics

## Algorithm finding

Given unit tests find the smallest code (python) to fullfil the unit tests.
