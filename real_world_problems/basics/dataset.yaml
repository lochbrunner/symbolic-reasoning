  trivial multiplication: 0*a => 0 
  # counting
  counting 2: 1+1 => 2
  counting 3: 1+2 => 3
  doubling: a+a <=> 2*a
  # others
  commutative property 1: a*b <=> b*a
  commutative property 2: a+b <=> b+a
  associative property: a*(b*c) => (a*b)*c 
  distributive property 1: a*(b+c) => a*b+a*c
  distributive property 2: a*(b-c) => a*b-a*c
  # neutrals
  neutral sum: a+0 => a
  neutral subtraction: a-0 => a
  neutral product: 1*a => a
  neutral division: a/1 => a
  # exponentiation
  square: a*a <=> a^2
  next exponent: a*a^n => a^(n+1)
  neutral exponent: a^1 => a
  trivial exponent: a^0 => 1
  # equations
  equation 1: a - b = 0 => a = b
  equation 2: x + a = 0 => x = -a
  equation 3: a / b = 1 => a = b
premises:
 - x = y
 - x = 0
 - x = 1
 - x = y + z
