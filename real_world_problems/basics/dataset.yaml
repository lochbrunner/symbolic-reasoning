  # others
  commutative property 1: a*b => b*a
  commutative property 2: a+b => b+a
  associative property 1: a*(b*c) <=> (a*b)*c
  associative property 2: a*(b/c) <=> (a*b)/c

  # neutrals
  neutral sum: a+0 <=> a
  neutral subtraction: a-0 => a
  neutral product: 1*a => a
  neutral division: a/1 => a
  # exponentiation
  square: a*a <=> a^2
  next exponent: a*a^n <= a^(n+1)
  neutral exponent: a^1 => a
  trivial exponent: a^0 => 1
  # equations
  equation 1: a - b = 0 => a = b
  equation 3: a / b = 1 => a = b
  equation 4: a = b => b = a
  equation 5: a + b = c <=> a = c - b
  divide multiplication: a*b = c <=> a = c/b
  subtraction 1: a - b <=> a + (-b)
